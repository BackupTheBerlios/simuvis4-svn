Qt's switches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are some switches common to all applications using Qt. Please look at the
`Qt documentation`_ for details.
One of the most important switches is ``--style=mystyle`` with mystyle being one of motif,
windows, platinum or one of the additional styles installed.

Example
~~~~~~~
Starting SimuVis with the commandline

::

    SimuVis.pyw --execute=mystart.py -l de -m

will give a maximized window in german language and execute the script mystart.py at startup.

Environment
-----------

You may set the variable ``SIMUVIS4_OPTIONS`` to contain one or more of the explained switches.

Example
~~~~~~~

Users of Windows XP can set the variable to the value ``-style=plastique`` to get a nicer look and feel.
Linux user may add the line

::

    export SIMUVIS4_OPTIONS="--language=en --fullscreen"

to their ``~/.bash_profile`` to let SimuVis start in english and fullscreen mode by default.
