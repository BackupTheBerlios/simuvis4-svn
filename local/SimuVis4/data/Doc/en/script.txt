Scripts
=======

SimuVis can run ordinary python scripts. These scripts get executed in the global
namespace and have complete access to the whole application. You may extend, reduce or
completely change the SimuVis application at runtime.

A script may be:

* run at startup with the -e commandline switch
* executed at any time with via menu or CTRL-E
* interactively entered with the PythonConsole_ plugin
* loaded, entered and edited in a TextEditor_ window and executed with CTRL-J
* send from other applications and even other computers with the RemoteControl_ plugin

Important facts to keep in mind
-------------------------------

Blocking
~~~~~~~~
Scripts are run in the main application loop and must not block for a long time. If your
script blocks the whole application will block and you have to kill SimuVis manually!

Security
~~~~~~~~
There is no restriction what the code may do. You may execute code that deletes
all your data, kills your cat or burns your house. You are responsible for all
wanted and unwanted effects of the code.

**IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR CONTRIBUTORS OF SIMUVIS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT,
INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE
EXECUTION OF PYTHON CODE IN SIMUVIS.**
