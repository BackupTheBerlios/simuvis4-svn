=======================
 PlugIn: PythonConsole
=======================
The plugin provides an interactive python console with a one-line input and formatted output.
The output may be printed or saved to a file.

The namespace is the global namespace of the application, you have access to all objects
of the running application!

When the plugin is loaded, all output to stdout (from ``print`` or ``sys.stdout.write()``)
will go to the console, not to a terminal. There can by only one console, either as a
DockWidget or as MDI-Subwindow. The status of the console window is usually toggled
with *'CTRL-D'*.

Configuration
=============
In a configfile_ you may use the following items:

::

    [pythonconsole]
    # bool: use a history file to store commandline inputs between sessions
    use_history = yes
    # bool: come as a dockwidget instead of MDI
    dockwidget = yes
    # bool: show window at startup
    show = no
    # bool: show maximized when showing
    show_maximized = yes
    # bool: show minimized when showing
    show_minimized = no
