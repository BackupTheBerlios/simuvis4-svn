 About SimuVis
===============
SimuVis in its current implementation SimuVis4 is a framework and an interactive
application for data handling, visualisation and simulations. It's based on python as the
programming language, Qt for the GUI, Qwt for charts and VTK for 3D scenes.
Currently it runs on Linux, Windows (both tested) and MacOS X (untested).

SimuVis4 is released as OpenSource. The GUI is available in english and german, more
languages can be added easily.

Target Audience
---------------
I develop SimuVis for my needs and the projects I'm working on. SimuVis should be useful:

* for the python programmer as a visual shell
* for the developer of scientific applications as a framework
* for the scientists as a tool for programming, data analysis and visualisation or a GUI for simulations

Architecture
------------
The SimuVis application is a typical MDI application written in PyQt. It can be custimized
by the following mechanisms:

* configuration files: system-wide, user-specific and explicit
* python scripts running inside the application with unlimited access to the whole program
* plugins to extend the programs abilities

Because all parts are written in the python language and there's no artificial border
between the parts of the program you may completely change or adjust the whole
applications functionality and appearance. You may so this even while the program is
running and use scripts or a comfortable shell window.

History
-------
The history of SimuVis started in 2001. I wrote a couple of python scripts using VTK to
visualise simulation results of solarthermal systems and buildings as colored 3D animations.
To ease this process an more general and modular application was developed. VTK was used as
the 3D-toolkit, the GUI was switched from Tkinter to Gtk+. We called this application
SimuVis and used it in some scientific projects.

The version SimuVis2 was based on Qt2 and later Qt3 because of its nicer API and the
existence of the powerful Qwt toolkit. SimuVis3 came to life only as a prototype.
The technical base of SimuVis4 is the new Qt4 and Qwt5 with its excellent python
bindings PyQt and PyQwt and still VTK for 3D things.
The application concept has changed a lot since the beginning. First versions were
focused on a (possibly animated) 3D scene, other elements were attached to 3D
objects. With the new MDI interface, different ways to browse and manipulate data can
coexist and can be used alternatively.

Name
~~~~
The origin of the name is should be obvious: a tool for **Simu** lation and **Vis** ualisation.
Please note that there is another software called SimuVis as part of the e-viz_ project.
When I started my SimuVis project and used the name frequently, there was no reference to
other projects with this name found on the internet.
