SimuVis4 on Windows
====================
To run SimuVis4 on Windows (2000 or newer) you need a recent python interpreter
and some additional modules. Unfortunately the version of the interpreter has to
match exactly the version for with the modules are build.

Installation
------------

1. Installing Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Please use the MSI-based installer for python 2.5 from http://www.python.org. Once you have
the python package installed, you can go on and install PyQt4.

2. Installig PyQt4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For Windows there's an experimental installer for PyQt and related packages at
http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/download.php . The current version should work
with python 2.5. After this step you should be able to run SimuVis4.

3. Installing SimuVis4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Follow the instructions for installing_.

4. Additional Modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To get all of SimuVis' plugins working you will need additional modules like
matplotlib or vtk. The people at Enthought did a very good job creating an
installer and providing precompiled packages for a lot of useful python modules.
The installer is called enstaller_, you may install it from the setup_ file and use
it to download and install additional packages. At the moment you may need VTK,
matplotlib, Scientific and netCDF for SimuVis4.

Using SimuVis4 on Windows
-------------------------
I suggest starting SimuVis with the commandline switch ``-style=plastique`` which gives
a much nicer visual appearance on Windows XP.
