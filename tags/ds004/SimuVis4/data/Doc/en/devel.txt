General
-------
Development takes place under Linux. The python files have UNIX line ends (LF) and utf8
encoding. All comments, documentation and output for the user should be in english language
by default. All strings visible in the GUI should use the i18n-mechanism to be easily translated.

Most recent information about the development is at the SimuVis homepage_.
