===================
 PlugIn: VtkWindow
===================
VTK_ - the visualisation toolkit - is a large library of components for
visualisation in 3D. It has a pipeline concept to handle and convert data and
uses OpenGL to render.

This plugin enables you to show vtk windows in SimuVis4 and provides some helper classes.
More documentation will follow soon.
