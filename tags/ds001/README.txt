This is the base folder of development of SimuVis. The SVN repository
is located at https://svn.origo.ethz.ch/simuvis/, the homepage of the
project is at http://www.simuvis.de/.

SimuVis4 contains the files for application and a set of basic plugins.
The contents should be packed to an installer or an archive once the
distutils support is complete.

AdditionalPlugIns contains some more or less useful plugins which may be
distributed separately from each other and from the application.

Both folders have a .devel subfolder with some script useful for developers.
