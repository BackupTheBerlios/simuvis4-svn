 Development
=============

General
-------
Development takes place under Linux. The python files have UNIX line ends (LF) and utf8
encoding. All comments, documentation and output for the user should be in english language
by default. All strings visible in the GUI should use the i18n-mechanism to be easily translated.

Folder Structure
----------------
There are two main folders: SimuVis4 and AdditionalPlugIns. This folders
do not depend on each other. Both have a subfolder called .devel with some helper scripts.

SimuVis4
~~~~~~~~
This folder contains the main program including needed data (images, translations etc.)
and a set of basic plugins. All this should go into one package when distributing
SimuVis (using distutils in the future). You may run SimuVis directly by executing
``bin/SimuVis.pyw``. If the program doesn't find its modules in the standard
locations (PYTHONPATH) it will assume it runs directly from the development folder and
it will adjust the settings according to this.
 
AdditionalPlugIns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
AdditionalPlugIns contains subfolders with additional plugins for SimuVis. Every
folder contains a single plugin. This plugins may be distributed seperately from
the main program and from each other.
