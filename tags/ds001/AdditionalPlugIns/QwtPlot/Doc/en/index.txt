 PlugIn: QwtPlot
=================
QwtPlot will make the usage of PyQwt5 in SimuVis4 more comfortable. At the moment
there are two concepts.

Plot window
===========
You may get a new window with a QwtPlotWidget and some helpers with the following command:

::

    ...
    # create a plot window
    plotWin = mainWin.plugInManager['QwtPlot'].winManager.newWindow('my new plotwindow')
    # attach a curve
    QwtPlotCurve('curve1').attach(plotWin.plot)
    ...

The attribute plot of a plot window is an instance of QwtPlot.

PyQt4.PyQwt5.qplt
=================
With this package PyQwt5 has an easy to use language for fast plotting of datasets.
You may use the package in SimuVis scripts. The commands ``Plot()`` and ``IPlot()`` will open a
MDI window with some buttons instead of the original windows. All other commands work
as expected. There's no need to import PyQt4.PyQwt5.iqt!

Example
-------
::

    from PyQt4.Qwt5.qplt import *
    xx = [0.1*a for a in range(50)]
    yy = [sin(a) for a in xx]
    Plot(Curve(xx, yy))
