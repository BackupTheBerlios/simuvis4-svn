   :align: right

To load a database, use the button at the toolbar. A tree of items will appear.
Most actions are available from the context menu (right mouse button) of an item.

Selecting an item in the treeview shows some information in the info area at the
bottom of the browser. Double-clicking on a sensor will open a QwtPlot_ window with
the sensors data. Double-clicking a chart will open a MatPlot_ window containing
the chart.

The expand/collapse button will expand or collapse all items in the browser window.

To search an item you enter the items name (or a part of it) in the search input and
press ENTER. If there's more than one matching item, pressing ENTER again without
changing the search text will jump to the next matching item. You may use wildcards
(``*`` and ``?``) in the search input.

The Help button opens a help browser with this information.

Database Actions
----------------
* close - close a database
* reload - will close and reopen the database
* edit metadata - edit the metadata of the database

Project Actions

* export data - export data to a file in CSV or MS Excel format
* edit metadata - edit the metadata of the sensorgroup

If the senorgroup has charts defined, you may:
* show all chart - open each chart in a new window
* save all charts - save each chart to an image file in a specified folder

Sensor Actions
--------------
* edit metadata - edit the metadata of the sensor
* plot (Qwt) or a doubleclick - will open a QwtPlot_ window showing a simple chart

Chart Actions

* show or a doubleclick - will open a MatPlot_ window showing the chart
* delete - will delete the chart from its parent sensorgroup


Configuration
=============
In a configfile_ you may use the following items:

::

    [datastoragebrowser]

    # path, optional: path to the folder containing the datastorage package,
    # if not installed in PYTHONPATH
    datastorage_path = /home/horst/lib/

    # path, optional: database to open at startup (folder containing h5 files)
    default_database = /home/horst/weather

    # bool: show chart subwindows maximized
    show_chart_maximized = no

    # bool: show chart subwindows using the size hint instead of fitting the window
    # see 'canvas zoom' of the MatPlot_ plugin for details
    show_chart_original_size = no

Hints
=====
* Please read the documentation for MatPlot_ (in particular about canvas zoom) and QwtPlot_!
* To save space you may show/hide the browser window with CTRL-B.
* You may place the browser window in other dock areas in th main windor or detach it completely.
* If more than one chart subwindow is opened, you may easily switch between the windows
  with CTRL-">" and CTRL-"<".
* Use Window > Cascade to see all windows.
* Use CTRL-M to switch between normal, maximized and shaded state for the active window.

If you use SimuVis4 mainly as a GUI for datastorage_ only you may enable/disable some of
SimuVis' features in your configfile_ to get a leaner GUI:

::
    
    [main]
    
    # hide the log window at startup
    hide_log_window = yes
    
    # hide the plugin browser at startup
    hide_plugin_browser = yes
    
    # add plugins not needed by DataStorageBrowser
    ignore_plugins = RemoteControl VtkWindow Graphics PythonConsole
    
    [databrowser]

    # show databrowser at startup
    show = yes
    
    # hide netcdf3 browser
    netcdf3_browser = no
    
    # hide filesystembrowser
    filesystem_browser = no
