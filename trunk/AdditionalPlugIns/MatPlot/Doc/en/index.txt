 PlugIn: MatPlot
=================
The PlugIn_ MatPlot provides support for the matplotlib in SimuVis. There's a special
matplotlib backend which opens plot windows as MDI subwindows in SimuVis. The window
appearance was choosen to be as close as possible to the other backends. In fact,
the SV4Agg backend is a slightly modified version of the Qt4Agg backend shipped
with matplotlib.

Using pylab
===========
Unfortunately this backend can't be added dynamically to be used with pylab. Some
matplotlib files need to be changed and one file needs to be copied. There's a
helper script to ease this process (``configure_matplotlib.py`` in the plugin folder).

In combination with the PythonConsole_, TextEditor_ or RemoteControl_ in combination
with your favourite text editor you may conveniently use the pylab interface to
matplotlib. You should use the backend 'SV4Agg' for interactice matplot sessions.
If you enable this feature in the configuration, ``matplotlib.use('SV4Agg'``) is set
by default in SimuVis4. If this is not possible because your matplotlib installation
was not modified, a message dialog is shown (but can be disabled).

Using matplotlib
================
You may use the backend manually, even if you did not change the matplot installation.
You will get the classes FigureManagerSV4, NavigationToolbar2SV4 and FigureCanvasSV4
from the plugin:

::

    ...
    mpl_backend = SimuVis4.Globals.plugInManager['MatPlot'].backend_sv4agg
    canvas = mpl_backend.FigureCanvasSV4(figure)
    ...

Versions
========
This plugin is tested with matplotlib 0.90.1 and 0.91.1 on linux and windows.

Known Problems
==============

* Printing with CTRL-P or the print button will save the figure to an SVG file
  and load it for rendering. This may result in figures missing some contents but gives
  you the well-known print dialog. If the result is bad, please save a figure
  to a PDF file and print it manually.
* pylab.show() will show all existing figures. If some module used matlab/pylab
  to render but didn't show the figures yet, calling ``pylab.show()`` may popup several
  (maybe empty) windows. You may get this with DataStorageBrowser_.
* In matplotlib 0.91.1 it seems impossible to switch backends with ``matplotlib.use(backend)``.
* ``set_default_backend`` must not be set when using the DataStorageBrowser_ plugin!


Configuration
=============
In a configfile_ you may use the following items:

::

    [matplot]
    
    # bool: try to set default backend to SV4Agg
    set_default_backend = yes
    
    # bool: show a warning when this backend is not available for pylab
    show_config_warning = yes
    
    # float: stepsize to enlarge or shrink when zooming canvas (0.2 = 20%)
    zoom_step_factor = 0.2
    
    # float: rotation distance of mouse wheel for one step, see explanation below
    mouse_wheel_step = 15

Interaction
===========
.. image:: Screenshot1.png

The first seven buttons in the toolbar are identical to the buttons in most interactive
matplotlib backends. Two additional buttons provide the following functions:

Printing
--------

The Print button or CTRL-P opens the well known print dialog, which lets you choose
papers size, orientation and other settings. See known problems above for details.

Canvas Zoom
-----------
When this button is activated, the size of the plot canvas is not bound to the window size.
While pressing CTRL you may zoom using the mousewheel or the keys '+' and '-'. If you
additionally press SHIFT, only the width of the canvas will change. This way you may
adjust the aspect ratio.

**Be careful and patient when zooming! It may need some time and a lot of memory because
matplotlib is not optimized for this kind of interactive usage.**

When one of the dimensions of the canvas exceeds the window size, the corresponding scrollbar
will appear. If the canvas is smaller than the window, no scrollbar is shown.

As soon as this mode is decativated (by pressing this button again) the plot canvas will
again fit the whole window.

You may adjust the zoom step in your configuration (see above). With ``zoom_step_factor``
you define the change of size along one axis (``new = old * (1+zoom_step_factor)``). This value
is used for both the key press and a step with the mouse wheel. If your wheel resolution
is not 15 degrees, you may want to adjust the value of ``mouse_wheel_step``.
