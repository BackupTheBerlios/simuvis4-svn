 SimuVis4 on Linux
===================
If you use Linux, it should not be to hard to install the required software packages.
Please use the package manager for your distribution.

Debian
------
For debian (and probably for derived distributions like ubuntu) there are .deb packages
available for the required additional software. You must have these packages (and the
packages required by these pakages, but apt will manage the dependencies for you):

* python2.4 or python2.5
* python-qt4 version 4.3 or newer

To get all plugins working, you should install these packages:

* python-qwt5-qt4
* python-scientific
* python-matplotlib
* python-vtk

SuSE
