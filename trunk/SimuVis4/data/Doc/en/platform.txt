General
-------
SimuVis is completely coded in python. It uses the PyQt4 toolkit for the whole
GUI part and will run on every platform where PyQt4 is available. At the moment
this includes Linux_, Windows_ and `MacOS X`_.
Running on `MacOS X`_ is currently untested and incomplete, but I hope to get this working soon.

Please read the special instructions for Linux_ and Windows_.
